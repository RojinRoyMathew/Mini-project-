<h1> ABOUT US</h1>
<P>

    In this website, we are taking users input details about their delivery needs, including pickup location, destination, delivery time window, and any discription about goods. The website's PHP backend interacts with a database containing information on available trucks, their current  locations, profile of drivers , sevice log contain details of order to deliver. Upon receiving the user's input, the website's backend runs an algorithm to determine the most efficient truckers for the selected delivery. This algorithm takes into account factors such as feedback for delivery of orders. As the algorithm processes, it continuously updates the route plan based on truckers dicision. Once the optimized route(s) are generated, the website presents them to the user along with estimated delivery times and costs. Users can provide feedback or make adjustments to the cost for delivery plan as needed.Once the user confirms the route plan, the website updates the database accordingly, assigns trucks to the designated deliveries, and provides drivers with detailed instructions for executing the deliveries.
